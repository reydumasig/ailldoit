# Deployment Issue Resolution

## Current Status
- ✅ Local production build works (HTTP 200)
- ❌ Deployed app returns 401 errors for static assets
- ✅ All environment variables present in deployment secrets

## Root Cause Analysis
The deployment is failing because the app is trying to authenticate static asset requests (CSS/JS files), which should be served without authentication.

## Issue: Authentication Middleware on Static Assets
The deployed app is incorrectly applying authentication middleware to static assets like:
- `/assets/index-D6N5O6eh.css`
- `/assets/index-CUT2MTfz.js`

These files should be served directly without authentication checks.

## Solution: Fix Route Order and Static File Serving

The issue is in the route configuration where authentication middleware might be applied globally instead of only to API routes.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Route Order**: Ensure static file serving happens BEFORE authentication middleware
2. **Verify serveStatic Function**: Make sure static assets are served without auth
3. **Rebuild and Redeploy**: Create new deployment with correct configuration

## Expected Behavior
- Static assets (CSS/JS) should return HTTP 200
- API endpoints should require authentication  
- Main app should load correctly
